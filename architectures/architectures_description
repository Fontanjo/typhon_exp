  split before the last 3 linear layers

unet -> https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/unet-implementation-in-pytorch-idiot-developer-da40d955f201
  v0 -> split after the entire recostruction, only one convolution in dm
  v1 -> split before last 1 block of reconstruction
  v2 -> split before last 2 blocks of reconstruction
  v3 -> split before last 3 blocks of reconstruction

## AUTOENCODERS ##

AE2Long
  uses conv with stride of 2 to reduce size
  structure: conv2d, batch_norm, relu
  central shape: 128x8x8 (8192)

AE3Long
  uses max pooling to reduce the size
  structure: conv2d, max_pool, batch_norm, relu
  uses convolution with different kernels: [9, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
  central shape: 512x2x2 (2048)

AE3LongerP
  same as AE3Long, but with an additional block at the beginning
   which does not increase the number of channels, but still
   reduces the size
  central shape: 512x1x1 (512)



## VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS ##
At the center, samples from a distribution

vae2
  based on AE2Long
  uses conv with stride of 2 to reduce size
  structure: conv2d, batch_norm, relu
  additional convolution for mu and var, with stride of 2
  central shape: 128x4x4 (2048)

vae2_mv
  same of vae2, but returns mu and logvar together with the output
  necessary to compute a better loss (BCE + KL-Divergence)

vae3_mv
  uses max pooling to reduce the size
  structure: conv2d, max_pool, batch_norm, relu
  additional convolution for mu and var, with stride of 2
  central shape: 512x1x1 (512)
