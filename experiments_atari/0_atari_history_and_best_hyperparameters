Tried:

- Problem: much effort at the beginning of learning is wasted in learning general env features (bg color, fixed pixels, ...)
  - Idea: overfit dm to mode image (of entire dset), then train loading it
  - Results: not working at all


- Problem: lr much different for every env
  - Idea: test each environment alone and find best lr
    - Then use best lr found --> results: actually not so well
    - Or, use the smallest one* --> results: not yet final results, but seems promising (with 3 envs at least)
    - Or, 'smooth' a bit to make more similar --> results: disaster



* Try to do more iterations for env which requires a bigger lr, to compesate the fact that we are using a smaller one
  e.g. phoenix requires 1e-3, qbert requires 1e-5  --> use 1e-5 for all, but do 100x more times phoenix
  Not tried yet, but not very optimistic..



Best lr for vae3_mv:
  - Phoenix:      1e-3
  - DemonAttack:  5e-5
  - Qbert:        5e-3 (not perfect)
  - Seaquest:     not found yet (tested 1e-3, 1e-4, 5e-5)
  - TimePilot:    not found yet (tested 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5)
  - Frostbite:    not found yet
  - FishingDerby: not found yet
